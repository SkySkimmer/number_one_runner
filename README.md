#BvS Number One Bot Runner
Runs the binary number one bot for you

# Building the extension

This is a firefox "web-extension", see mozilla's docs.

# Dependencies

Requires BvS Number One Bot 0.4.1 or later https://github.com/SkySkimmer/number_one

You must install the bot binary yourself:
- get the compiled executable (number\_one\_main), its data file
  (n1bot\_data.bin), the python wrapper (number\_one\_wrapper.py) and
  the number\_one.json from https://github.com/SkySkimmer/number\_one
  (the executable must be compiled, and data file must be generated by
  the executable)
- put the first 3 in the same directory somewhere
- if you didn't put them in /usr/local/bin/, modify the json and py
  files accordingly ("/usr/local/bin/number\_one\_main" in py and
  "/usr/local/bin/number\_one\_wrapper.py" in the json should point to
  the right place)
- put the number\_one.json in the right place according to
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native\_messaging#App\_manifest\_location
